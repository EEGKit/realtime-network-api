# Pupil Labs Realtime Network API

The Pupil Labs Realtime Network API is used for streaming data from the Pupil Invsible Companion in realtime over the local network.
It is also used to send realtime events and remotly control the Companion App.

This repository contains the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification
for the Pupil Labs Realtime Network API.
